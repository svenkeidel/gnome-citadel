** TODO Bugs
*** BUG Assigning tasks twice on same field -> error
gnome-citadel: the identifer 'Tile {_id = Identifier 22, _charRepr =
'#'}' has no assigned coordinate
- don't do it twice if same task present (different equality check)
=> new equality check, BUT erases previous task
*** DONE Mining task is assigned although tool not available
    CLOSED: [2014-10-15 Wed 13:33]
- check if actor satisfies required task prerequisites
=> does no longer occur
*** DONE After picking up tool, actor 'resets' to start point
    CLOSED: [2014-10-15 Wed 12:59]
...and continues from there
=> coroutines
*** DONE Chosen task is not the one nearest to actor
    CLOSED: [2014-10-15 Wed 13:00]
=> new heuristic for scheduling
